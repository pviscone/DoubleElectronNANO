# NanoAOD producer customized for BParking analyses 

The focus is on RK/K*/phi analyses.

## Recipe

This recipe is for 12_4_X. The original recipe for 10_2_X can be found [here](https://github.com/CMSBParking/BParkingNANO/blob/master/README.md).

Currently using release CMSSW_12_4_11_patch3.

### Getting started

```shell
scram list CMSSW
cmsrel CMSSW_12_4_11_patch3
cd CMSSW_12_4_11_patch3/src
cmsenv
```

### Add modifications needed to use post-fit quantities for electrons

```shell
git cms-merge-topic -u DiElectronX:GsfTransientTracks_124X # unsafe checkout (no checkdeps), but suggested here
```

### Add modifications to KinematicParticleVertexFitter

```shell
git cms-merge-topic -u DiElectronX:fixKinParticleVtxFitter_124X # unsafe checkout (no checkdeps), but suggested here
```

### Add the BParkingNano package

```shell
git clone git@github.com:DiElectronX/BParkingNANO.git ./PhysicsTools
git cms-addpkg PhysicsTools/NanoAOD
# instead of:
# git cms-merge-topic -u DiElectronX:NanoAOD_131X
```

### Build and run on a test file

```shell
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/
scram b -j 8
cd PhysicsTools/BParkingNano/test
cmsRun run_nano_cfg.py        # by default, runs over Run 3 data
cmsRun run_nano_cfg.py isMC=1 # runs over MC for 2022
```

### Submit CRAB jobs to process Run 3 data and 2022 MC 

```shell
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/PhysicsTools/BParkingNano/production
python3 submit_on_crab.py
```

## Provenance and branches

- This repo is forked from https://github.com/CMSBParking/BParkingNANO 
- The fork was made at revision https://github.com/CMSBParking/BParkingNANO/tree/b9bcad0b9b
- This revision is tagged as https://github.com/DiElectronX/BParkingNANO/tree/from-BParkingNANO
   - Tag also available as https://github.com/CMSBParking/BParkingNANO/tree/from-BParkingNANO

**Default branches:**
- The default branch in CMSBParking is https://github.com/CMSBParking/BParkingNANO/tree/master
- The default branch in DiElectronX is https://github.com/DiElectronX/BParkingNANO/tree/main

The default branch has been renamed for two reasons:

1) To promote more inclusive terminology, as per the GitHub guidelines
2) To clearly differentiate between the different development thread of the two repositories, namely:
   - CMSBParking/BParkingNANO:master targets the CMSSW development cycle CMSSW_10_2_X
   - DiElectronX/BParkingNANO:main targets the CMSSW development cycle CMSSW_12_4_X

Further, two additional branches have been produced based on the revision above:

- CMSBParking/BParkingNANO:CMSSW_10_2_X and CMSBParking/BParkingNANO:CMSSW_12_4_X
- DiElectronX/BParkingNANO:CMSSW_10_2_X and DiElectronX/BParkingNANO:CMSSW_12_4_X

which may be of use. For example:

- CMSSW_10_2_X developments in CMSBParking/BParkingNANO should be merged into the master (and CMSSW_10_2_X) branch 
- CMSSW_12_4_X developments in CMSBParking/BParkingNANO should be merged into the CMSSW_12_4_X branch
- CMSSW_10_2_X developments in DiElectronX/BParkingNANO should be merged into the CMSSW_10_2_X branch 
- CMSSW_12_4_X developments in DiElectronX/BParkingNANO should be merged into the main (and CMSSW_12_4_X) branch
